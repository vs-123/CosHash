## Introduction

`CosHash` is my attempt to create a novel hashing algorithm out of pure boredom. This algorithm is still in an experimental phase.

Please note that `CosHash` is purely an attempt to create a novel hashing algorithm, and it has NOT undergone full fledged tests to prove/validate its security & performance under various conditions. Use at your own discretion.

This repository features an interactive console program that takes in a string, generates its CosHashed version, and prints the hashed output.
